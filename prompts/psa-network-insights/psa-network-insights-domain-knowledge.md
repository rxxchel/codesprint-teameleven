## 1. Business Context

### PSA's Global Strategy

**Vision**: Create a digitally integrated, future-ready trade ecosystem that delivers visibility, agility, and efficiency across the global supply chain.

**Strategic Pillars**:
1. **Digital Integration**: Ports, logistics hubs, and warehouses function as integrated nodes with real-time data exchange
2. **Operational Synergy**: Seamless coordination across the entire supply chain network
3. **Resilience**: Ability to navigate geopolitical disruptions, tariffs, regulatory shifts, and climate impacts
4. **Sustainability**: Green operations focused on carbon reduction and fuel efficiency
5. **Innovation**: Leveraging AI (classical optimization, generative AI, and agentic AI) for continuous improvement

### 2025 Global Trade Environment

**Challenges**:
- Geopolitical flashpoints disrupting traditional trade routes
- Escalating tariffs increasing operational costs
- Regulatory shifts requiring adaptive compliance
- Labor unrest impacting port operations
- Climate-driven disruptions (extreme weather, sea level changes)
- Supply chain fragmentation

**PSA's Response**:
The Network Insights dashboard represents PSA's data-driven approach to maintaining "faster, greener, and smarter" global trade despite these challenges.

## 2. Dashboard Structure

### Overview
The **Network Insights Dashboard** provides a single-pane view of PSA's global network performance, enabling users to:
- Monitor key operational and sustainability metrics
- Identify trends and patterns across time periods
- Drill down into specific liners, services, or port locations
- Make data-informed decisions quickly

### Data Coverage
- **Time Period**: January 2025 - September 2025 (9 months)
- **Geographic Scope**: Global PSA network (9 nodes/business units in current dataset)
- **Operational Scope**: 10 liner operators, 30 services, 300 port calls
- **Update Frequency**: Near real-time (based on vessel movements and operations data)

### Data Limitations & Important Notes

**Sample/Anonymized Dataset:**
This dashboard uses sample or anonymized data, particularly for hackathon and demo environments. Key implications:

1. **Dynamic Filter Contents**: The terminals, shipping lines, and services appearing in filters are determined solely by what data exists in the Power BI dataset for the selected date range. Users cannot assume any specific terminal, liner, or service will be available without checking the filters.

2. **Scrollable Filter Lists**: Many filter sections (Nodes, Services, Liners) contain more items than fit in the initially visible area. The filter pane must be scrolled to see all available options. For example, if the dashboard shows "Nodes: 9" but only 5 are immediately visible, the remaining 4 require scrolling down in the filter list.

3. **Future Date Data**: The 2025 date range indicates this is simulated/projected data rather than actual historical operational data.

4. **Anonymization**: Liner and service codes (e.g., AZQ, BLX, 03J) appear to be anonymized representations rather than actual company names and route identifiers.

**Best Practice for AI Responses:**
- Always scroll through and verify what's actually available in the dashboard filters before making statements about specific terminals
- Don't report a terminal as "unavailable" without checking the complete scrollable filter list
- If a user asks about a terminal, scroll through the full filter before confirming whether it exists in the dataset

## 13. Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Monthly Executive Briefing
**Scenario**: Executive needs quick performance summary for board meeting

**User**: "Summarize this month's performance"

**AI Response**:
"September 2025 shows solid network performance: 16% port time savings (above our 15% target), with $654K in bunker savings generating 7.1K tonnes of carbon abatement. Arrival accuracy stands at 61%, slightly below our 80% targetâ€”recommend prioritizing prediction model refinement. Compared to peak performance in June (20% savings, $951K), we're maintaining strong efficiency despite seasonal variation."

### Use Case 2: Customer Meeting Preparation
**Scenario**: Account manager preparing for liner customer review

**User**: "Show me performance for liner BLX"

**AI Response**:
"Liner BLX operations demonstrate strong collaboration with PSA: their vessels achieved 17% average port time savings (above network average of 14%) and 75% arrival accuracy. BLX's port calls contributed approximately $850K in bunker savings and 9.2K tonnes carbon abatement over the period. Key strength: consistent performance across multiple nodes. Opportunity: Improving arrival accuracy from 75% to network target of 80% could unlock additional efficiency gains."

### Use Case 3: Anomaly Investigation
**Scenario**: Operations manager notices unexpected metric drop

**User**: "Why did arrival accuracy drop in March?"

**AI Response**:
"March shows 41% inaccurate arrivals (vs 19% in February), a significant variance. This corresponds with a 13% port time savings (vs 16% in February), suggesting external disruptions may have affected schedules. Recommend investigating: (1) weather events during March, (2) specific services or routes with highest inaccuracy, (3) upstream port delays. Filter by service and liner to pinpoint root cause and prevent recurrence."

### Use Case 4: Best Practice Identification
**Scenario**: Continuous improvement team seeking optimization ideas

**User**: "What were the success factors in our best performing month?"

**AI Response**:
"June achieved exceptional results: 20% port time savings, $951K bunker savings, and 81% arrival accuracy. Analysis suggests: (1) Strong coordination across linersâ€”all 10 liners active with balanced workload, (2) Peak efficiency in cargo handling reduced turnaround time, (3) Accurate arrival predictions enabled optimal resource allocation. Recommend conducting June operations retrospective to document best practices, then pilot replication in August-September timeframe."
