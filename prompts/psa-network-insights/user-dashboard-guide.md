# PSA Network Insights Dashboard - User Guide

## What You're Looking At

Welcome to the PSA Network Insights Dashboard! This is your window into PSA's global port network performance. Think of it as your command center for understanding how efficiently cargo ships move through PSA's terminals worldwide.

---

## The Big Picture: What This Dashboard Does

Imagine you're managing a global network of ports where massive cargo ships arrive, unload/load containers, and depart. This dashboard shows you:

1. **How efficiently we're operating** (are ships in and out quickly?)
2. **How much money we're saving** (fuel efficiency)
3. **Our environmental impact** (carbon emissions reduced)
4. **How predictable we are** (do ships arrive when we expect them?)

All of this data helps PSA make smarter decisions to keep global trade moving smoothly.

## Dashboard Layout - From Top to Bottom

### üìä Top Section: The Summary Cards

These six big numbers at the top tell you the "headline story" at a glance:

#### **Liners: 10**
- **What it is:** The number of different shipping companies using PSA's network
- **Why it matters:** More shipping lines = more business and diversity
- **In plain English:** "We're currently serving 10 different shipping companies"

#### **Services: 30**
- **What it is:** The number of different shipping routes/trade lanes
- **Why it matters:** Shows how many different routes connect through our network
- **In plain English:** "Ships travel on 30 different routes through our ports"

#### **Nodes: 9**
- **What it is:** The number of PSA ports/terminals in this network
- **Why it matters:** This is the size of our global footprint
- **In plain English:** "We operate 9 different port terminals worldwide"

#### **Calls Made: 300**
- **What it is:** Total number of times ships have visited our ports
- **Why it matters:** This is our volume - how busy we are
- **In plain English:** "300 ships have docked at our terminals in this period"

#### **Total Bunker Saved (USD): $5.55M**
- **What it is:** Total money saved on ship fuel through efficiency
- **Why it matters:** Proof that optimization saves real money
- **In plain English:** "By being efficient, we've saved shipping companies $5.55 million in fuel costs"
- **How it happens:** Faster port service = ships spend less time with engines running = less fuel burned

#### **Total Carbon Abatement (K tonnes): 58.13**
- **What it is:** Total carbon emissions prevented (58,130 tonnes)
- **Why it matters:** Shows our environmental impact
- **In plain English:** "We've prevented 58,130 tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere"
- **Real-world equivalent:** That's like taking about 12,600 cars off the road for a year

### üìà Performance Details Section: The Charts

This is where you see trends and patterns over time (January to September 2025).

#### **1. Port Time Savings vs baseline**
**The Green Bar Chart (Monthly Bars)**

- **What it shows:** How much faster we're processing ships compared to our historical average
- **How to read it:**
  - Each green bar = one month
  - Height of bar = percentage improvement
  - Higher bars = better performance

- **What you're seeing:**
  - January: 11% faster than baseline
  - February: 19% faster (great month!)
  - March: 11% faster
  - April: 16% faster
  - May: 13% faster
  - **June: 20% faster (best month!)**
  - July: 9% faster
  - August: 18% faster
  - September: 16% faster

- **Why it matters:** When ships spend less time in port, shipping companies save money, and we can handle more ships. A 20% improvement means a ship that used to take 10 hours now takes only 8 hours.

- **Key insight:** June was our star month. We should study what went right!

#### **2. Arrival Accuracy**
**The Line Chart (Green and Red Lines)**

- **What it shows:** How often ships arrive within our predicted time window
- **How to read it:**
  - **Green line (Y):** Percentage arriving accurately (GOOD - we want this high)
  - **Red line (N):** Percentage arriving late/early (BAD - we want this low)
  - The two lines always add up to 100%

- **What you're seeing:**
  - Varies from about 59% to 82% accurate across months
  - Best accuracy: Around 82% in some months
  - Worst accuracy: Around 59% in other months

- **Why it matters:** When we can accurately predict ship arrivals, we can:
  - Schedule the right number of workers
  - Have cranes ready
  - Plan better for the next ship
  - Give better information to cargo owners

- **Key insight:** We're hovering around 60-80% accuracy. Getting consistently above 80% would be a major win.

#### **3. Bunker Savings (USD)**
**The Green Bar Chart (Dollar Amounts)**

- **What it shows:** Month-by-month fuel cost savings
- **How to read it:** Each bar shows that month's savings in millions of dollars

- **What you're seeing:**
  - January: $0.27M (lowest)
  - February: $0.54M
  - March: $0.53M
  - April: $0.73M
  - May: $0.55M
  - **June: $0.95M (nearly $1 million!)**
  - July: $0.45M
  - August: $0.87M
  - September: $0.65M

- **Why it matters:** This is real money back in shipping companies' pockets. It also makes PSA more attractive to customers.

- **Key insight:** June saved almost $1M in fuel costs - that correlates with the 20% port time savings!

#### **4. Carbon Abatement (K tonnes)**
**The Green Bar Chart (Environmental Impact)**

- **What it shows:** How many tonnes of carbon emissions we prevented each month
- **How to read it:** Each bar = thousands of tonnes of CO2 not emitted

- **What you're seeing:**
  - January: 3.1K tonnes
  - February: 5.5K tonnes
  - March: 6.5K tonnes
  - April: 6.1K tonnes
  - May: 7.1K tonnes
  - **June: 8.6K tonnes (best!)**
  - July: 5.5K tonnes
  - August: 8.5K tonnes
  - September: 7.1K tonnes

- **Why it matters:**
  - Environmental responsibility
  - Corporate sustainability goals
  - International shipping regulations (IMO 2030/2050 targets)
  - Good for the planet AND good for business

- **Key insight:** Notice how carbon savings mirror fuel savings? That's because less fuel burned = fewer emissions. Win-win!
